# BucketListApp-ReactJS
This is a React.js app. It gives the user the ability to create a bucket list of his own and then have the application tell him which item to do next from his list.

This is an app I personally use to note down something that I want to do, like wanting to visit a place later
or some restaurant that I see on TV and I want to eat later. This app is just quick to note that down as a list and not have to worry about signing in or any other complex options.
